ScaleDown
==========

An on demand image scaling server.

Images are scaled based upon their URL. An HMAC signature is used to prevent unauthorized scaling of images.

Supports cropping images and converts CMYK to RGB.

URL Schema
==========

Your file on `example.com` has a public path of `/images/john/picture.png`. You want it scaled to fit in a 400x400 pixel box.  **ScaleDown** is running on the subdomain `images`.

The URL to your image would be:

    http://images.example.com/images/john/scaled/400x400/picture.png?HMAC_SIGNATURE

The scaled file is saved in a public path identical to the request. Once an image is scaled your webserve can statically server the file.

The schema is

    http://:host/:path_to_file/scaled/:geometry/:filename?:hmac_signature

    :host           the address running ScaleDown
    :path_to_file   the public path of the original file
    `scaled`        keyword
    :geometry       width x height and an optional `-crop`
    :filename       the filename of the original image to scale
    :hmac_signature security measure to validate the request


Geometry & Cropping
====================

To crop an image include the `-crop` option.  The image will be scaled and cropped to fit the geometry.

    http://images.example.com/images/scaled/400x300-crop/logo.png?A3SDACEDF

Using `auto` as a dimension will fit the image to the other dimension.

For example, to ensure an image is 300 pixels wide set the height to auto

    http://images.example.com/images/scaled/300xauto/logo.png/?A3SDACEDF

There is a very simple `/info` function for getting image dimensions. It just returns a string with the WIDTHxHEIGHT.

    http://images.example.com/images/logo.png/info


HMAC
====

You don't want someone taking down your server with malicious URLs, so an HMAC signature is used.  This ensures that your URL was generated by a trusted source.

HMAC requires a shared key between the application generating the URL and the ScaleDown server.

Sample Ruby URL Generator
=========================

    ```ruby
    require 'ruby-hmac'

    def signed_image_url(absolute_path, filename, geometry)
      shared_secret = "secret"
      hmac = HMAC::SHA1.new(shared_secret).update([absolute_path, 'scaled', geometry, filename].join("/")).to_s[0...8]
      "http://images.example.com#{[absolute_path, 'scaled', geometry, CGI.escape(filename)].join("/")}?#{hmac}"
    end

=== Sample Node.js URL Generator

    ```javascript
    // Uses the Node.js crypot library
    var crypto = require('crypto')

    function hmac(string){
      var shared_secret = "secret"
      return crypto.createHmac('sha1',shared_secret).update(string).digest('hex').substr(0,8)
    }

    function signed_image_url(absolute_path, filename, geometry){
      signature = hmac( [ absolute_path, '/scaled', "/" + geometry, "/", filename].join("") )
      return [global.$FD.assetHost,  absolute_path, '/scaled', "/", geometry, "/",escape(filename)].join("") + "?"+ signature
    }

PNG, JPG, TIFF and other images supported
========================================

ScaleDown will handle any image that Image Magick can process.  But there are some rules:

* PNGs remain PNGs
* All other images are converted to JPG and issued a 301 redirect

Installation & Configuration
==============================

    gem install scale_down

Create a Rackup file (config.ru). See https://github.com/jweir/ScaleDown/tree/master/config_sample.ru more options

    ```ruby
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'scale_down'

    ScaleDown.tap do |config|
      # Shared secret for generating the HMAC signature
      config.hmac_key    = "secret"

      # Path to the public directory
      config.public_folder = File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__))+"/public"
    end

    run ScaleDown::Controller

Configure Nginx, Apache, etc to run the server.

Known Issues
===========

Pluses in filenames will not route properly.  Filenames need to have these removed or replaced.

Dependencies
============

* Sinatra
* RMagick
* Ruby-HMAC

RMagick can be a bit tricky to install, these links[http://www.google.com/search?q=install+rmagick] might help.
